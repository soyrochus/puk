# Puk documentation bundle (reverse-engineered)

This bundle was generated by scanning the repository and summarizing concrete evidence from source files.
Start here:

1. [Index](./00_index.md)
2. [Overview](./10_overview.md)
3. [Architecture](./20_architecture.md)

If you want intended behaviors and user-facing flows:
- [Functional sources](./15_functional_sources.md)
- [User flows](./60_user_flows.md)

Operational notes:
- [Ops & runtime](./70_ops_and_runtime.md)

Caveat: No explicit `functional_sources` were provided to the generator; functional documentation is therefore derived mostly from `README.md` + `specs/**`.
