## Puk is a local, agentic code generation and automation tool that.

Puk is a local, agentic code generation and automation tool that provides a Copilot-like experience outside of the IDE. It runs as a command-line application with an interactive REPL and optional rich terminal UI, and uses the GitHub Copilot SDK to plan and execute multi-step tasks through explicit tools. Puk operates within a defined workspace by default, asks for confirmation before mutating actions, and supports both interactive and non-interactive execution modes. It can generate and modify Python code, execute commands, and run isolated Python environments, while keeping the human in control through clear policies, diffs, and audit logs.
